# Rust GNFS Implementation

Welcome to the Rust implementation of the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), the most advanced algorithm used for factoring large integers. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient implementation of GNFS, leveraging the power and safety of Rust.

## Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by AdamWhiteHat's GNFS implementation and a deep interest in cryptography. It is intended for educational and research purposes, focusing on continuous improvement and validation of the implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust (latest stable version) https://www.rust-lang.org/
- Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system)

You can install Rust and Cargo using rustup, which is the recommended toolchain manager for Rust projects.

### Building the Project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielrcurtis/gnfs
cd rust-gnfs
cargo build --release
cargo test
```
